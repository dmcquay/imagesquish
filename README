INSTALL

1. Install node. Good instructions here: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#ubuntu-mint
2. git-clone this repo or download the latest tarball. Just put it in your home directory.
3. cd ezimg-server and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Create config/aws.json with your AWS credentials. (TODO: provide example)
5. Create config/config.json. (TODO: provide default or example)
6. An easy way to run is using Forever. Just `npm install forever` and then `forever start app.js`.
7. You might want to add node_modules/.bin to your path. Otherwise you'll have to do `node_modules/.bin/forever start app.js`.

Note about running on port 80. Only root can do that, but you should not run this as root. Instead, I suggest
one of these options:

1. Use iptables to redirect port 80 to another port.
   `sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000`
2. Just run it on port 3000. You should be putting a CDN in front of this anyway, which will hide your weird port
   from your users.

To test uploading an image on the command line:

curl http://localhost:3000/default/upload --data-binary @Scan.jpeg -H "Content-Type:image/jpeg" -v

For manipulation configurations, see the node gm docs:

I have also provided some custom operations:
